# TransportVis

In this projcet, I develope a software to visualize the transportation pattern of Great Britain.  The main feature of this software is to provide the ability to explore the
longitudinal transportation data of Great Britain and visually compare changes and trends over the years.
We try to answer to what extent the transportation network has directly impacted the population and job
distribution in major cities of Great Britain, and vice versa.
This software implemented in C++ and the libraries I used are Qt, OpenGL and VTK and two components QCustomplot and QMapControl. 


## Description
This software has three features:
- Visualizing the streamlines.
- Extract the Morse sets in different levels.
- Visualizaing the Morse sets.

## libraries
I used 
- [VTK6.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-75-downloads-archive)
- [Qt4.8](https://www.qt.io/)
- [OpenGL2.1]

## install
In order to run this code, you need to 
- Install Qt5.8 library.
- Install CUDA7.5 library.
- Install OpenGL 2.1

and you can use the software.
